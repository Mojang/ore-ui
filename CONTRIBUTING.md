# Creating a new release

Currently the process of updating the version of the packages is mostly manual. Before you start, first you need to make sure you have the permissions to publish the packages.

- If there is a release branch (see **Release candidate** below) that hasn't been merged to `main` yet now is the time to do so.
- Make sure that you are logged in into your `npm` account. Use the command `yarn npm login` on the project folder to do this.
- While on the `main` branch.
- Perform a search an replace on all "package.json" files from the old version to the new. (ex `0.1.4` to `0.2.0`). Ensuring it only affects packages doing the version bump.
- Run `yarn` to update the lockfile.
- Commit the changes with a message containing the new version (ex: `0.2.0`).
- Create an annotated git tag by running `git tag -a v0.2.0` (replace with the version). The tag message can be the version again.
- Push commit and the tag `git push --follow-tags`.
- Publish the packages by running `yarn publish` (it will also build the packages).
- Then head to GitHub to draft a new release https://github.com/Mojang/ore-ui/releases/new
- Choose the tag and click the button "Auto-generate release notes"
- Click "publish release" ðŸš€

## Release candidate

- Make sure that you are logged in into your `npm` account. Use the command `yarn npm login` on the project folder to do this.
- Create a branch including the changes for the release candidate and name the branch to the same thing as the upcoming release, eg: `v0.4`.
- Perform a search an replace on all "package.json" files from the old version to the new. (ex `0.3.12` to `0.4.0-rc.0`).
- Run `yarn` to update the lockfile.
- Commit the changes with a message containing the new version (ex: `0.4.0-rc.0`).
- Create an annotated git tag by running `git tag -a v0.4.0-rc.0` (replace with the version). The tag message can be the version again.
- Push commit and the tag `git push --follow-tags`.
- Publish the packages by running `yarn publish --tag rc` (it will also build the packages).
- We are currently not doing release notes for release candidates so you are all done! ðŸŽ‰

# Copilot Custom Instructions Maintenance

## Using Copilot Slash Command (Recommended)

The easiest way to check and fix the Copilot custom instructions is using the slash command:

```
/fix-instructions
```

This will:

1. Run both sync check scripts
2. Identify desyncs between code and custom instructions
3. Automatically fix issues in both instruction files
4. Verify the fixes
5. Show you a summary of changes

## Using Scripts Directly

You can also run the validation scripts directly:

```bash
# Check if custom instructions are in sync with code
./scripts/check-copilot-instructions-sync.sh
./scripts/check-public-api-instructions-sync.sh

# Or check both at once
./scripts/check-copilot-instructions-sync.sh && \
./scripts/check-public-api-instructions-sync.sh
```

See [Scripts README](scripts/README.md) for more details.

## When to Update Custom Instructions

Update the Copilot custom instructions when you:

- Add/remove/modify public APIs (hooks, components, utilities)
- Update package structure or import paths
- Add new best practices or patterns
- Change how features work

Both instruction files should be kept in sync with the codebase:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Full internal guide for contributors/Copilot
- `.github/copilot-instructions-public-api.md` - Public API reference for users

**Note:** These are custom instructions for GitHub Copilot, not the user-facing documentation site (which is in `docs/`).
